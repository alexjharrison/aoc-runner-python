## \--- Part Two ---

Due to some kind of monkey-elephant-human mistranslation, you seem to have misunderstood a few key details about the riddle.

First, you got the wrong job for the monkey named `root`; specifically, you got the wrong math operation. The correct operation for monkey `root` should be `=`, which means that it still listens for two numbers (from the same two monkeys as before), but now checks that the two numbers _match_.

Second, you got the wrong monkey for the job starting with `humn:`. It isn't a monkey - it's _you_. Actually, you got the job wrong, too: you need to figure out _what number you need to yell_ so that `root`'s equality check passes. (The number that appears after `humn:` in your input is now irrelevant.)

In the above example, the number you need to yell to pass `root`'s equality test is `_301_`. (This causes `root` to get the same number, `150`, from both of its monkeys.)

_What number do you yell to pass `root`'s equality test?_

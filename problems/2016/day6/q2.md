## \--- Part Two ---

Of course, that _would_ be the message - if you hadn't agreed to use a _modified repetition code_ instead.

In this modified code, the sender instead transmits what looks like random data, but for each character, the character they actually want to send is _slightly less likely_ than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at the letter distributions in each column and choose the _least common_ letter to reconstruct the original message.

In the above example, the least common character in the first column is `a`; in the second, `d`, and so on. Repeating this process for the remaining characters produces the original message, `advent`.

Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology, _what is the original message_ that Santa is trying to send?
